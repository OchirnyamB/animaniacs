<span>Step 2: </span><span>How to Read (manga)</span>

<p>Reading manga is not the same as reading any other book or graphic novel. First off, you have to read from the right cover to the left cover. Also, you have to read from top to bottom, right to left. It's important to remember that right to left always beats top to bottom. Here are some sites where you can read manga:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://manga4.com/">Manga4</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.mangareader.net/">mangareader.net</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://manga.animea.net/">animea</a></li>
</ul>

<span>Step 3: </span><span>Anime</span>

<p>It's easy to find anime to watch; if you liked a manga, there will most likely be an anime with the same name. Here are some sites where you can watch anime:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.crunchyroll.com/">crunchyroll</a> (This one is the safest, but it does have a lot of advertisements)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.animefreak.tv/">AFTV</a> (This one has more options, but it may not necessarily be the safest) </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.watchcartoononline.com/">AnimeDub</a></li>
</ul>

<section>
<span>Step 4: </span><span>Fandoms</span>

<p>Now that you have (hopefully) found a favorite anime or manga, what next? Well the adventure still continues of course! Being part of a fandom means purchasing merchandise, browsing through tumblr, reading/writing fanfic, and of course <a href="http://www.cosplay.com/">COSPLAYING!</a></p>
