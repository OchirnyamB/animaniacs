    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>The root of all evil is madness, but madness exists in everything. In order to control this paradox, Meisters and their Weapons --human parterns that can transform into weapons-- battle against fledgling demons and witches.</p><p> Maka Alban and her weapon Soul Eater, Black Star and his weapon Tsubaki, and Death the Kid and his weapons Patricia and Elizabeth Thompson strive to become the strongest protectors of humanity. To accomplish this, they attend an Academy founded by Lord Death, who has bound his soul to a city under which the first demon lord's remains reside. Should he ever re-awaken, the world would be ripped asunder-and these unlikely heroes will have to exceed even their own potentials to prevent that from becoming a reality.</p>
