    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Akihisa Yoshii is the ultimate baka --idiot-- as he attends the Fumizuki Academy, a school where academic scores mean everything; from placements in their classes to the type of amenities their classrooms have to offer. Class A is the best of the best with the highest-scoring students, the best items, and the want for nothing; while Class F has the lowest of the low and the worst facilities.</p><p>When exceptionally intelligent Mizuki Himeji is too sick to finish her test, she is sent to Class F, though she should have ranked as first in the school. In a bid to win her attention, Akihisa pushes for a Summoned Being War, an academic and real war based on the school's unique fact that students can call forth Summoned Beings. These beings, or avatars, vary on power and skills based on the academic strength and knowledge of its caller. Just how can Akihisa, Mizuki, and their fellow Class F students, compete against the prodigal Class A students?</p>
