    <h2>#2. Attack in Titan</h2>
    <--add picture here-->
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <h4>Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by titans--creatures that are several stories tall, with no intelligence and a hunger for devouring human beings. To survive, humanity confined themselves in a city protected by extremely high walls.</h4>
    <h4>In present time, humanity lives peacefully and protected, not having seen a titan in over a 100 years. But, then everything changed suddenly. Eren Jaegar and his sister Mikasa Ackerman swear vengance upon the titans after they witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a colossal titan.</h4>
