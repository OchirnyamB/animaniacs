    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>They are neither plants nor animals. They differ from other forms of life such as the micro-organisms and the fungi. Instead they resemble the primeval body of life and are generally known as Mushi. Their existence and appearance are unknown to many and only a limited number of humans are aware of them. Ginko is a Mushi-shi who travels around to investigate and find out more about the Mushi. In the process, he also lends a helping hand to people who face problems with supernatural occurances which may be related to the Mushi.</p>
