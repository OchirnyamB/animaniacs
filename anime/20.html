    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Not long after he enters high school, Sakai Yuji’s normal days come to an end. When he was on his way home he witnessed a shocking view as the world suddenly froze: people were engulfed by blue flames and a monster resembling a large doll swallowed them. Just when he's about to be killed, a girl in a dark cloak wielding a large sword appears, and slices the monster in half. Although Yuji survives the strange encounter, the girl, Shana,  informs him of a desolate truth: " 'You' don't exist anymore.</p><p>She calls herself a Flame Haze, who hunts "Guze no Tomogara"; intruders from another world. She explains to him that he is a "Torch", a substitute of Yuji whose “existence” has already been devoured. She also told him that he is a special Torch, "Mystes", which contains a precious item in it. Now they are in an eternal fight against Tomogara and other Flame Hazes.</p>
