    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Kurosaki Ichigo, 15-years-old, is not any average boy; he has the ability to see and communicate with ghosts and spirits. Ichigo does what he can for the spirits he meets, until a Hollow --evil soul spirit-- attacks him and his family. To the rescue comes a female Shinigami, known as a Death God, named Kuchiki Rukia. Rukia chases the Hollow off, and is astounded by the fact that Ichigo can see her and the Hollow, which most mortals cannot.</p><p>Rukia explains that Shinigami have two duties: to lead the good souls to their rest in Soul Society, and to exterminate Hollows, who endanger them. But, when the second Hollow attacks Ichigo, Rukia transfers her Shinigami powers to him. His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife.</p>
