    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>When Teru's older brother died, she was left with little more than a cell phone containing the text-address of an elusive character named DAISY, who Teru's brother had told her would "support her when he was no longer able to."</p><p>One afternoon, after bullies from the student council are mysteriously driven away, Teru accidentally breaks a school window, which results in her working for the grouchy, cruel school janitor named Tasuku Kurosaki. As Teru begins working for the unlikable school janitor, her feelings begin to surpass that of master and servant and she begins to question DAISY's true identity. Thus begins an unlikely friendship between a 16-year-old high school girl and a sly but smart 24-year-old man.</p>
