    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Quiet and unassuming Mei Tachibana is 16-years-old, but has spent her high school years without making friends or getting a boyfriend because of a childhood incident that left her believing that people will betray each other sooner or later. One day, she injures a popular boy in school, Yamato Kurosawa, because of a misunderstanding but for some reason it seems that he takes a liking to her and one-sidedly claims that theyâ€™re friends. It is through their tentative friendship and blossoming relationship that Mei ultimately begins to branch out and befriend others.</p>
