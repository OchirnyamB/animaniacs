    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>In the year 2022, Kirito, a solo player who had played the beta version, and the many other players of Sword Art Online are trapped inside of the game. Unable to logout, the only way to live is to win. Death in-game means death in the real world, tampering or prolonged power outage with the Nerve Gear --the gear that simulates in-game character control-- also means death. To win means to defeat the final boss on the top floor, and out of the original 10,000 players at the start, two years later 6000 remain and 26 floors are left to clear.</p>
