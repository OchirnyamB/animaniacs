    <h2>About Animaniacs</h2>
    <section>
    <p>This is the page all about the Animaniacs team. We work hard so that you can be informed on all things anime and manga. The animaniacs came together because we are taking a class on webdesign, and this is the topic we picked our project to be about. There are four people in the animaniacs team Sarah (the walking anime dictionary), Maryam (intermidiate), Flavio (intermidiate), and Tanishka (the noob). Our goal is to help those that are just beginning to take the very first steps into the anime world. For example we have common used words in anime, and what the best 20 anime and best 20 manga (in our opinion) are so you can continue anime and manga.</p>
